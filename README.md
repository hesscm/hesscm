### Chris Hess (He/Him)
## Full Stack Developer

Hey everyone! My name is Chris and I am currently finishing up my time at Prime Digital Academy. I am a former military musician and am incredibly excited to break into the software development industry. 

What's below? 

You can check out a few of my most recent React App projects. Definitely check out 'QuickMeals', which is my personal project I built in a 2 week time frame. I also completed a degree in Computer Science and have my final project from about a year ago listed below.

What now?

Currently I am about to begin another 2 week sprint but this time I will collaborate with 3 other developers and a real world client. This group project helps preachers and congregations better find each other with the simplicity of this single application.
